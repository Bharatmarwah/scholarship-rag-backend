/**
 * Full student profile taxonomy, grouped by domain. Values are used by the
 * scheme definitions, the query composer, the question builder and the
 * profile enrichment step.
 *
 * <p>No scheme uses every field. Each {@link SchemeDefinition} selects the
 * fields it needs and classifies them as discovery, essential, conditional or
 * selection. Numeric eligibility thresholds (income ceilings, percentiles,
 * disability cut-offs) are intentionally NOT part of this enum.
 *
 * <p>Some fields are scheme-relevant today but do not yet map to a
 * {@code StudentProfile} column: {@code STUDY_LEVEL}, {@code COURSE_TYPE},
 * {@code APPLICATION_TYPE}, {@code ADMISSION_RANK},
 * {@code HAS_VALID_DISABILITY_CERTIFICATE}, {@code HAS_UDID_OR_UDID_ENROLLMENT},
 * {@code SIBLINGS_RECEIVING_BENEFIT}, {@code GENDER}, {@code DATE_OF_BIRTH},
 * {@code STREAM}, {@code CLASS12_PASSED_YEAR} and {@code DISABILITY_TYPE}.
 * They are read as missing until the profile stores them.
